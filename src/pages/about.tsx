      I am a software engineer and accessibility advocate who builds applications for both web and
      mobile. I believe that the web should work for everyone, regardless of their abilities or
      circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spend a lot of time educating myself and others on how to make websites and applications
      accessible. I write about accessibility, design systems, CSS, React, SwiftUI, and React Native
      in my blog. <Link to="/blog">You can read my posts here.</Link>
    </p>
    <p>I have a bachelor&apos;s degree in Sociology from Northwestern University.</p>
