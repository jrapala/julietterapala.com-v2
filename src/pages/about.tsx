      I am a software engineer and accessibility advocate who builds applications for both web and
      mobile. I believe that the web should work for everyone, regardless of their abilities or
      circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spend a lot of time educating myself and others on how to make websites and applications
      accessible. I write about accessibility, design systems, CSS, React, SwiftUI, and React Native
      in my blog.{' '}

      When I&apos;m not at my computer, I enjoy fitness (weightlifting, cycling, and hiking), going
      to concerts, baking desserts, and watching movies. I&apos;m a big bookworm and enjoy both
      reading and writing fiction.
